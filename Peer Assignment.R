# In my following function makeCacheMatrix, I determined that my function will be applied
# to x, that is my matrix in current environment.
# Then I set the value of a, my anonymous variable, to be NULL.
# Next, I assigned value to my matrix according to an anonymous function using
# the <<- operator. Thus, the value set is different than my current environment.
# Next, I used 'get' to tell R to fetch the values within my matrix.
# Next, I used 'setInv' to explain to R that the function (Inv) applied
# to my current anonymous variable `a` is also set as the (Inv) in the envoriment
# that is different from my current one
